Join Example Database

Create a database named join_test_db and run the SQL provided in the Join Example DB section above; to create the same setup used for this lesson.

Insert 4 new users into the database. One should have a NULL role. The other three should be authors.

Use join, left join, and right join to combine results from the users and roles tables as we did in the lesson. Before you run each query, guess the expected number of results.

Although not explicitly covered in the lesson, aggregate functions like count can be used with join queries. Use count and the appropriate join type to get a list of roles along with the number of users that has the role. Hint: You will also need to use group by in the query.

Employees Database

Using the example in the Associative Table Joins section as a guide, write a query that shows each department along with the name of the current manager for that department.
